    Ensure the Developer mode toggle switch at the top right corner is turned on.
4. Load the Extension:

    Click the "Load unpacked" button.
    Navigate to the ```couch-voyager``` directory that you cloned in step 1 and select it.

5. Enjoy Couch Voyager:

    The Couch Voyager extension should now be installed and ready to use in your Chrome browser.
